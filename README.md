# Multi-chart QA

This repository contains the questions and answers for our Multi-chart Benchmark. At present, only the data is available, but the test code will be provided soon. We welcome everyone to use and explore our benchmark!

## Introduction

Multi-chart QA is an extensive and demanding benchmark that features real-world charts. We source charts from various places to ensure both diversity and completeness. Each multi-chart group includes 2 or 3 charts, and each group is accompanied by 4 questions, typically spanning four distinct main categories. The Multi-chart QA dataset comprises 236 groups, totaling charts and 944 questions.
