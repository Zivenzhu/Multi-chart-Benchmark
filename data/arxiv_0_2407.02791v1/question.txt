Question 1: What does the vertical axis in the first chart represent?
Note that This a choice question. Your final answer should be the option that most closely matches the question. If the chart has multiple subplots, answer based on the subplot on the left and at the bottom. You should only output the option, such as A, B, C, or D, as the answer without the content in the option.
A. State space covered
B. Number of words in the text
C. Number of sentences
D. Percentage of correct answers

Question 2:
1. What is the rightmost labeled tick on the horizontal axis in the second chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the tick value on the horizontal axis that is explicitly written, including the case when horizontal axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the horizontal axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.
2. How many colours are used for the bars in the first chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the total number of colours used for the bars in the chart across multiple subplots. If the plot is not considered a bar plot, answer '0'.
3. How many labels are there on the vertical axis in the third chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the total number of labels on the vertical axis across multiple subplots. If the chart does not have explicit labels on the vertical axis, answer '0'.
Now that you have got the answers for the three questions. Your answer format should be as follows:
Answer: The_answer_for_the_first_question; The_answer_for_the_second_question; The_answer_for_the_third_question

Question 3: How many of the same tick values are there on the vertical axis in the third chart and the second chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the number of the same tick values on the vertical axis across multiple subplots in the third chart and the second chart. If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value. If these two charts do not have ticks with the same label on the vertical axis, answer '0'.

Question 4: 1. Which tester has the lowest state space covered value in semantic states in the first chart?
Note that your answer should be a textual tick on the horizontal axis.
2. Which vertical tick entity has the lowest average semantic state coverage rate in the third chart?
Note that your answer should be a textual tick on the vertical axis.
Now that you have got the answers for the two questions. Your answer format should as follows:
Answer: The_answer_for_the_first_question; The_answer_for_the_second_question
