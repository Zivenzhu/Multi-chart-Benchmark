        "question": "The first chart is <image>. The second chart is <image>. The third chart is <image>. Question: What is the spatially lowest labeled tick on the vertical axis in the third chart? \nNote that Your final answer should be the tick value on the vertical axis that is explicitly written, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",

        "question": "The first chart is <image>. The second chart is <image>. The third chart is <image>. Question:\n1. What is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the horizontal axis in the second chart? \nNote that Your final answer should be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the horizontal axis, including the case when the horizontal axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit horizontal axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, answer 'Not Applicable'.\n2. How many distinct colors are used to represent different countries in the first chart? \nNote that Your final answer should be the total number of distinct colors in the chart across multiple subplots. If the plot is not considered a bar plot, answer '0'. Note that you should exclude \"Not defined by inhabitants\".\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.

Question: How many of the same tick values are there on the horizontal axis in the third chart and the second chart? \nNote that Your final answer should be the number of the same tick values on the horizontal axis across multiple subplots in the third chart and the second chart. If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value.
