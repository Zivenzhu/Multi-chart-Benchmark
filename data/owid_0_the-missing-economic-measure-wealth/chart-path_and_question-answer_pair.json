        "question": "The first chart is <image>. The second chart is <image>. The third chart is <image>. Question: What is the leftmost labeled tick on the horizontal axis in the third chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the tick value on the horizontal axis that is explicitly written, including the case when horizontal axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the horizontal axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",

What was the adjusted net savings per capita for France in 2010 in the first chart?\nNote that your final answer must be approximated to the nearest vertical tick value in the chart. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.\n2.
