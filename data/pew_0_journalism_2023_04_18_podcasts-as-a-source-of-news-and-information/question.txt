Question 1: How many distinct bars are there in the third chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the total number of distinct bars in the chart across multiple subplots. Note that If a bar has multiple segments, count it as one bar. If the plot is not considered a bar plot, answer '0'.
Note that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get

Question 2:
1. What does the color dark brown indicate in the second chart?
Note that your final answer must be grounded to some text that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart. If you need to answer multiple terms, separate them with commas. Unless specified in the question (such as answering with a letter), you are required to answer the full names of subplots and/or labels by default.
2. What is the percentage of U.S. adults who have listened to a podcast in the past 12 months according to the first chart?
Note that your final answer must be grounded to a number that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart, even if it is an approximate value. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.
Now that you have got the answers for the two questions. Your answer format should be as follows:
Answer: The_answer_for_the_first_question; The_answer_for_the_second_question

Question 3: How many of the same colors are used to draw bars in both the second chart and the third chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the number of the same colors used to draw bars between the second chart and the third chart across multiple subplots. If the second and the third charts don't have any bars with the same colour or either of them is not a bar chart, answer '0'.
Note that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get

Question 4: 1. What is the percentage of U.S. adults who have listened to a podcast and say news is not discussed on the podcasts they listen to in the past 12 months among all the U.S. adults in the first chart?
Note that your final answer must be the exact answer.
2. What is the result of subtracting the percentage of U.S. podcast listeners who say entertainment is a minor reason from the percentage who say it is a major reason in the second chart?
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to a number, even if it is an approximate value. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.
Now that you have got the answers for the two questions. Your answer format should be as follows:
Answer: The_answer_for_the_first_question; The_answer_for_the_second_question
