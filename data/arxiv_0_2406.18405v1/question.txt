Question 1: How many subplots are there in the third chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the total number of subplots in the plot. If the plot does not contain subplots, answer '1'.
Note that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get

Question 2:
1. What is the layout of the subplots in the second chart? (Answers should m by n)?
Note that Your final answer should follow 'n by m' format, where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. If the plot does not contain subplots, answer '1 by 1'.
2. What is the numerical value of F_Total in the bottomost and leftmost subplot of the first chart?
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to a number that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart, even if it is an approximate value. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.
Now that you have got the answers for the two questions. Your answer format should be as follows:
Answer: The_answer_for_the_first_question; The_answer_for_the_second_question

Question 3: How many of the same tick values are there across all axes in the second chart and the third chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the number of the same tick values across all axes, including the case when any axis is shared across multiple subplots in the second chart and the third chart. If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value. If these two charts do not have ticks with the same label on the vertical axis, answer '0'.

Question 4: 1. What is the ΣF chiral in the subplot with colours indicating negative values in the second chart?
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to a number that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart, even if it is an approximate value. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.
2. What is the ΣF chiral in the subplot with colours indicating negative values in the third chart?
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to a number that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart, even if it is an approximate value. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.
Note that you have got the answer for the above two questions, the final answer is the answer to the second question minus the answer to the first question.
