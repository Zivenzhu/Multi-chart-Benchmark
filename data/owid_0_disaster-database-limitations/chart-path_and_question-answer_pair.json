        "question": "The first chart is <image>. The second chart is <image>. The third chart is <image>. Question: What is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the horizontal axis in the third chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the horizontal axis, including the case when horizontal axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit horizontal axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",

        "question": "The first chart is <image>. The second chart is <image>. The third chart is <image>. Question: \n1. What is the spatially highest labeled tick on the vertical axis in the second chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the tick value on the vertical axis that is explicitly written, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot.If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\n2. What is the percentage of 'Small' events in the 2000s in the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer must be grounded to a number that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart, even if it is an approximate value. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.

        "question": "The first chart is <image>. The second chart is <image>. The third chart is <image>. Question: How many of the same tick values are there on the horizontal axis in the first chart and the second chart?\nNote that your final answer should be the number of the same tick values on the horizontal axis across multiple subplots in the first chart and the second chart. If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value. If the first and the second charts do not have ticks with the same label on the horizontal axis, answer '0'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",

Question: First, identify the year among all the horizontal ticks when the number of recorded natural disaster events is closest to 100 in the third chart.\nThen in this year, which label in the legend has the largest global number of reported disasters in the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer must be grounded to some text that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart. If you need to answer multiple terms, separate them with commas. Unless specified in the question (such as answering with a letter), you are required to answer the full names of subplots and/or labels by default.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",
