What is the spatially highest labeled tick on the vertical axis in the third chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the tick value on the vertical axis that is explicitly written, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot.If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer 'Not Applicable'. \n2. What is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the vertical axis in the second chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the vertical axis, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit vertical axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.

Question: How many of the same countries are there on the horizontal axis in the second chart and the third chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the number of the same countries on the horizontal axis across multiple subplots in the second chart and the third chart. If a chart has multiple countries from different subplots with the same name, count them as only one distinct country.
