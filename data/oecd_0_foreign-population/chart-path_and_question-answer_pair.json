Question: What is the spatially lowest labeled tick on the vertical axis in the first chart? \nNote that Your final answer should be the tick value on the vertical axis that is explicitly written, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot.

You should only output the option, such as A, B, C, or D, as the answer without the content in the option.\nA. Increasing\nB. Increasing then decreasing\nC. Decreasing\nD. Decreasing then increasing\n2.

When the vertical axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot.
