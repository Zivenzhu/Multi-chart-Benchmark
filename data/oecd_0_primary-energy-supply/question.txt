Question 1: 
1. How many labeled ticks are there on the horizontal axis in the first chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the total number of labeled ticks on the horizontal axis across multiple subplots. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the horizontal axis, answer '0'.
2. What is the highest bar value in the second chart?
Note that your final answer must be approximated to the nearest vertical tick value in the chart. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.
Now that you have got the answers for the two questions. Your answer format should be as follows:
Answer: The_answer_for_the_first_question; The_answer_for_the_second_question

Question 2: How many of the same tick values are there on the vertical axis in the second chart and the first chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the number of the same tick values on the vertical axis across multiple subplots in the second chart and the first chart. If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value. If the second and the first charts do not have ticks with the same label on the vertical axis, answer '0'.
Note that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get

Question 3: Note that the blue bar represents the average Primary energy supply.
In which year the average Primary energy supply is the largest among all the years?
Note that your answer should be a specified year, such as 'Answer: 2000'.

Question 4: Firstly extract the largest Primary energy supply for each year of 2022, 2017 and 2012.
Then which year's largest Primary energy supply is the largest?
Note that your answer should be a specified year, such as 'Answer: 2000'.
