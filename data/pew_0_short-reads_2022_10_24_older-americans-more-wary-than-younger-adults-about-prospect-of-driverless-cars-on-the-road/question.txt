Question 1: How many explicitly written labels are there on the vertical axis in the second chart? 
Note that Your final answer should be the total number of explicitly written labels on the vertical axis across multiple subplots. If the chart does not have explicitly written labels on the vertical axis, answer '0'.
Note that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get

Question 2: 
1. What is the value of the green bar on the topmost side in the first chart? 
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to a number that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart, even if it is an approximate value. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed. 
2. What is the value of the green bar representing 'Ages 50+' for 'Buses for public transportation' in the second chart? 
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to a number that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart, even if it is an approximate value. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.
Now that you have got the answers for the two questions. Your answer format should be as follows:
Answer: The_answer_for_the_first_question; The_answer_for_the_second_question

Question 3: How many of the same colors are used to draw segments, such as bars or dots, in both the second chart and the first chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the number of the same colors used to draw segments, such as bars or dots, between the second chart and the first chart across multiple subplots. If these two charts don't have any segments, such as bars or dots, with the same color, answer '0'.

Question 4: Firstly identify an age group which has the largest percentage of people think that the impact on traffic accidents will decrease with the use of driveless vehicles among all the age groups in the first chart.
Then for this age group, what is the percentage of U.S. adults who say they would favor the use of technology used to operate driverless passenger vehicles for Taxis and ride-sharing vehicles in the second chart?
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to a number that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart, even if it is an approximate value. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.
Note that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get
