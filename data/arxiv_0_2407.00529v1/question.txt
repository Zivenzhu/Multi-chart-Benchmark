Question 1: How many of the same tick values are there across all axes in the first chart and the third chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the number of the same tick values across all axes, including the case when any axis is shared across multiple subplots in the first chart and the third chart. If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value. If these charts do not have ticks with the same label on the vertical axis, answer '0'.

Question 2: In which chart the Recall gap between our models and the base model is the largest when number of variables is 10?
Note that your answer should be only one option from (First, Second or Third)

Question 3: In which chart the Recall of both our models and base model achieves the local maximum when number of variables is 14?
Note that your answer should be only one option from (First, Second or Third)

Question 4: Firstly extract a label in the legend of the third chart, with the title called First-order Direct Relations, whose line is below the other line.
Then, for this label in the first chart with the title called Confounded Pairs, identify the number of variables from the axis tick values (10, 12, 14, 16, 18) where the Precision line of the label achieves its local minimum.
Note that your answer should be only one option from (10, 12, 14, 16, 18).
