        "question": "The first chart is <image>. The second chart is <image>. The third chart is <image>. Question: How many of the same tick values are there across all axes in the first chart and the third chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the number of the same tick values across all axes, including the case when any axis is shared across multiple subplots in the first chart and the third chart. If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value. If these charts do not have ticks with the same label on the vertical axis, answer '0'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",
