Question 1: How many distinct bars are there in the first chart?

Question 2: 
1. What does the darkest blue segment in the bar 'Addressing climate change is __ to them personally' represent in the first chart? 
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to some text that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart. If you need to answer multiple terms, separate them with commas. Unless specified in the question (such as answering with a letter), you are required to answer the full names of subplots and/or labels by default.
2. What does the vertical axis in the second chart represent?
Note that This is a choice question. Your final answer should be the option that most closely matches the question. If the chart has multiple subplots, answer based on the subplot on the left and at the bottom. You should only output the option, such as A, B, C, or D, as the answer without the content in the option.
A. Different generations of Republicans
B. Percentage of Republicans and Republican leaners
C. Different groups or sectors being evaluated for their efforts to reduce the effects of global climate change

Question 3: How many of the same colors are used to draw segments, such as bars or dots, in both the second chart and the first chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the number of the same colors used to draw segments, such as bars or dots, between the second chart and the first chart across multiple subplots. If these two charts don't have any segments, such as bars or dots, with the same color, answer '0'.
