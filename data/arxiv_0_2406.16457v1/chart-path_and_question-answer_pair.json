If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer '0'.\n2. What is the layout of the subplots in the b group in the second chart? (Answers should m by n)?\nNote that Your final answer should follow 'n by m' format, where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. If the plot does not contain subplots, answer '1 by 1'.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.
