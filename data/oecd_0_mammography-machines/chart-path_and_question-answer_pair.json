        "question": "The first chart is <image>. The second chart is <image>. The third chart is <image>. Question: What is the spatially lowest labeled tick on the vertical axis in the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the tick value on the vertical axis that is explicitly written, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot.If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",

How many labeled ticks are there on the horizontal axis in the third chart? \nNote that your final answer should be the total number of labeled ticks on the horizontal axis across multiple subplots. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the horizontal axis, answer '0'.\n2. What does the vertical axis in the second chart represent?\nNote that This a choice question. Your final answer should be the option that most closely matches the question.If the chart has multiple subplots, answer based on the subplot on the left and at the bottom. You should only output the option, such as A, B, C, or D, as the answer without the content in the option.\nA. The total number of mammography machines in each country\nB. The percentage of population with access to mammography machines\nC. The total number of mammography machines per 1,000,000 inhabitants, 2017\nD.
