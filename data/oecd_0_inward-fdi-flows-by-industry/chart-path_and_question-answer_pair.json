What is the leftmost labeled tick on the horizontal axis in the third chart? \nNote that Your final answer should be the tick value on the horizontal axis that is explicitly written, including the case when horizontal axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the horizontal axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\n2.

Question: How many of the same labels are there on the horizontal axis in the second chart and the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the number of the same labels on the horizontal axis across multiple subplots in the second chart and the first chart. If a chart has multiple identical labels from different subplots, count them as only one distinct label. If these two charts do not have any same labels on the horizontal axis, answer '0'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",
