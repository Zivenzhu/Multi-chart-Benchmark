Question 1: 
What does the vertical axis in the second chart represent?
Note that This is a choice question. Your final answer should be the option that most closely matches the question. If the chart has multiple subplots, answer based on the subplot on the left and at the bottom. You should only output the option, such as A, B, C, or D, as the answer without the content in the option.
A. The percentage of U.S. adults who support the use of facial recognition technology
B. Different groups of U.S. adults based on race
C. Various potential outcomes of using facial recognition technology by police
D. The level of fairness perceived by U.S. adults regarding facial recognition technology
Note that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get

Question 2: 
1. What percentage of White adults believe police use of facial recognition technology would make policing more fair in the first chart? 
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to a number that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart, even if it is an approximate value. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed. 
2. What is the name of the label with the lowest percentage of Black people in the third chart?
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to some text that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart. If you need to answer multiple terms, separate them with commas. Unless specified in the question (such as answering with a letter), you are required to answer the full names of subplots and/or labels by default.
Now that you have got the answers for the two questions. Your answer format should be as follows:
Answer: The_answer_for_the_first_question; The_answer_for_the_second_question

Question 3: How many of the same race group labels are there both in the first chart and the third chart? 
Note that Your final answer should be the number of the same race group labels across multiple subplots in the third chart and the first chart. If a chart has multiple identical race group labels from different subplots, count them as only one distinct year label. If these two charts do not have the same race group labels, answer '0'.
Note that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get

Question 4: 1. Which issue has the largest percentage of Hispanic people who think it definitely would happen if the use of facial recognition technology by police becomes widespread among all the issues in the second chart?
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to some text that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart. If you need to answer multiple terms, separate them with commas. Unless specified in the question (such as answering with a letter), you are required to answer the full names of subplots and/or labels by default.
2. What is the percentage of White adults who say people were notified of the public events and public spaces that were scanned for facial images would make the use of facial recognition technology by police more acceptable in the third chart? 
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to a number that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart, even if it is an approximate value. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.
Now that you have got the answers for the two questions. Your answer format should be as follows:
Answer: The_answer_for_the_first_question; The_answer_for_the_second_question
