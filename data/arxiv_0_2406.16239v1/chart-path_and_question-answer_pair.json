What is the difference between the log(BER) value of the topmost and the bottommost on the colour bar in the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer must be grounded to a number that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart, even if it is an approximate value. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.\n2. How many colours are used for the lines in the second chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the total number of colours used for the lines in the chart across multiple subplots.
