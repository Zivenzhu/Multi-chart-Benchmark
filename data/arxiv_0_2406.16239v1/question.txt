Question 1:
1. What is the difference between the log(BER) value of the topmost and the bottommost on the colour bar in the first chart?
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to a number that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart, even if it is an approximate value. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.
2. How many colours are used for the lines in the second chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the total number of colours used for the lines in the chart across multiple subplots. If the plot is not considered a line plot, answer '0'.
Now that you have got the answers for the two questions. Your answer format should be as follows:
Answer: The_answer_for_the_first_question; The_answer_for_the_second_question

Question 2: How many identical labels are there in the legends of the second chart and the first chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the number of identical labels in the legends of the second chart and the first chart across multiple subplots. And your final answer should account for only labels relevant to the plot in the legend, even if the legend is located outside the plot. If any of the plots do not have a legend, or if the legend is not considered relevant to the plot, answer '0'.

Question 3:
1. Between CPR-phase and CV SWKRLS-phase, which has the lower RMS phase fluct. [rad] value at 9 stages in the second chart?
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to some text that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart. If you need to answer multiple terms, separate them with commas. Unless specified in the question (such as answering with a letter), you are required to answer the full names of subplots and/or labels by default.
2. Between CPR and CV SWKRLS, which has the lower BER value at 9 stages in the first chart?
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to some text that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart. If you need to answer multiple terms, separate them with commas. Unless specified in the question (such as answering with a letter), you are required to answer the full names of subplots and/or labels by default.
Now that you have got the answers for the two questions. Your answer format should be as follows:
Answer: The_answer_for_the_first_question; The_answer_for_the_second_question

Question 4: Firstly find a stage when the RMS amplitude fluct. is approximately 0.20 for CV SWKRLS-amp in the second chart. Then what is the nearest vertical tick value to the BER value of CV SWKRLS at this stage in the first chart?
Note that your final answer must be approximated to the nearest vertical tick value in the chart. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.
