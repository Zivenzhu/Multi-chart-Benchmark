Question 1: What is the title of the third chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the most relevant title of the plot that is explicitly written. If the plot does not have an explicit title or contains only a letter, answer 'Not Applicable'.
Note that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get

Question 2: 1. How many distinct bars are there in the first chart?
Note that: Your final answer should be the total number of distinct bars in the chart across multiple subplots. Note that if a bar has multiple segments, count it as one bar. If the plot is not considered a bar plot, answer '0'.
2. What is the spatially highest labeled tick on the vertical axis in the second chart?
Note that: Your final answer should be the tick value on the vertical axis that is explicitly written, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.
Now that you have got the answers for the two questions. Your answer format should be as follows:
Answer: The_answer_for_the_first_question; The_answer_for_the_second_question

Question 3: How many of the same labeled countries are there in the second chart and the third chart?
Note that your answer should be a natural number.
Note that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get

Question 4: Firstly, among all the countries listed in the third chart, extract the country which has the highest percentage of people aged 30 to 49 who are very or somewhat concerned that global climate change will harm them personally at some point.
Then how many points does this country's percentage of people, who are very concerned that global climate change will harm them, increase from 2015 to 2021 in the second chart?
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to a number, even if it is an approximate value. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.
If the country doesn't exist, answer 'Not Applicable'
Note that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get
