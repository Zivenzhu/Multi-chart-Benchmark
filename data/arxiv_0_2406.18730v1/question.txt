Question 1: How many labeled ticks are there on the vertical axis in the first chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the total number of labeled ticks on the vertical axis across multiple subplots. If the chart does not have explic
it labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer '0'.

Question 2:
1. What is the spatially lowest labeled tick on the vertical axis in the third chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the tick value on the vertical axis that is explicitly written, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.
2. What are the names of the labels in the legend of the second chart? (from top to bottom, then left to right)
Note that You should write down the labels from top to bottom, then from left to right and separate the labels with commas. Your final answer should account for only labels relevant to the plot in the legend, even if the legend is located outside the plot. If the plot does not have a legend or no legend is not considered relevant to this plot, answer 'Not Applicable'.
3. What does the vertical axis in the first chart represent?
Note that This a choice question. Your final answer should be the option that most closely matches the question. If the chart has multiple subplots, answer based on the subplot on the left and at the bottom. You should only output the option, such as A, B, C, or D, as the answer without the content in the option.
A. Star Formation Rate (SFR) in logarithmic scale
B. H-alpha emission line velocity dispersion
C. Helium II emission line luminosity in logarithmic scale
D. Observed X-ray luminosity in the 2-10 keV range in logarithmic scale
Now that you have got the answers for the three questions. Your answer format should be as follows:
Answer: The_answer_for_the_first_question; The_answer_for_the_second_question; The_answer_for_the_third_question

Question 3: How many of the same tick values are there across all axes in the first chart and the third chart?
Note that your final answer should be the number of the same tick values across all axes, including the case when any axis is shared across multiple subplots in the second chart and the first chart. If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value. If the second and the first charts do not have ticks with the same label on the vertical axis, answer '0'.

Question 4: First find the nearest log(L2-10keV, observed [erg s^-1]) axis tick value t1 for Expected X-ray emission from WR star nebula when log(LHe II/[erg s^-1]) is 40.0 in the third chart. 
Then when the log(L2-10keV, observed [erg s^-1]) of Grimm+2003, Lehmer+2010, Mineo+2012, Gilfanov+2014= t1, what is the nearest horizontal tick value to the corresponding log(SFR[M☉ Yr⁻¹]) value in the first chart?
Note that your final answer must be approximated to the nearest horizontal tick value in the chart. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.
