Question 1: What is difference between consecutive numerical tick values on the vertical axis in the third chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the difference between consecutive numerical tick values of the vertical axis, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit vertical axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, or if the difference is not constant between all consecutive tick values, answer 'Not Applicable'.

Question 2:
1. What is the rightmost labeled tick on the horizontal axis in the second chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the tick value on the horizontal axis that is explicitly written, including the case when horizontal axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the horizontal axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.
2. What is the total number of explicitly labeled ticks across all axes in the \(\delta_{RMS_{\phi_1}}\) subplot of the first chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the total number of explicitly labeled ticks across all axes in the \(\delta_{RMS_{\phi_1}}\) subplot of the chart. If the subplot does not have any explicit labeled ticks across all axes, answer '0'.
Now that you have got the answers for the two questions. Your answer format should be as follows:

Question 3: 1. How many distinct lines are there in the first chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the total number of distinct lines in the chart across multiple subplots. Ignore grid lines, tick marks, and any vertical or horizontal auxiliary lines. If the plot does not contain any lines or is not considered a line plot, answer '0'.
2. What is the layout of the subplots in the third chart ? (Answers should m by n)
Note that Your final answer should follow 'm by n' format, where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. If the plot does not contain subplots, answer '1 by 1'
Now that you have got the answers for the two questions. Your answer format should be as follows:
Answer: The_answer_for_the_first_question; The_answer_for_the_second_question

Question 4: How many identical labels are there in the legends of the second chart and the third chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the number of identical labels in the legends of the second chart and the third chart across multiple subplots. And your final answer should account for only labels relevant to the plot in the legend, even if the legend is located outside the plot. If any of the plots do not have a legend, or if the legend is not considered relevant to the plot, answer '0'.
