Question 1: What are the names of the labels in the legend of the third chart? (from top to bottom, then left to right)
Note that You should write down the labels from top to bottom, then from left to right and separate the labels with commas. Your final answer should account for only labels relevant to the plot in the legend, even if the legend is located outside the plot. If the plot does not have a legend or no legend is not considered relevant to this plot, answer 'Not Applicable'.
Note that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get

Question 2:
1. What is the value of the orange bar in the second chart under the "White" category?
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to a number that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart, even if it is an approximate value. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.
2. What is the percentage of U.S. adults who have NOT heard the phrase "affirmative action" in the first chart? 
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to some text that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart. If you need to answer multiple terms, separate them with commas. Unless specified in the question (such as answering with a letter), you are required to answer the full names of subplots and/or labels by default.
Now that you have got the answers for the two questions. Your answer format should be as follows:
Answer: The_answer_for_the_first_question; The_answer_for_the_second_question

Question 3: How many of the same colors are used to draw bars in both the first chart and the third chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the number of the same colors used to draw bars between the first chart and the third chart across multiple subplots. If the first and the third charts don't have any bars with the same colour or either of them is not a bar chart, answer '0'.
Note that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get
