Question 1: What is the layout of the subplots in the second chart? (Answers should m by n)
Note that Your final answer should follow 'n by m' format, where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. If the plot does not contain subplots, answer '1 by 1'.

Question 2: 1. How many explicitly written labels are there across all the axes in the third chart?
Note that your answer should be a natural number.
2. What is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the labels on the vertical axis in the second chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the labels on the vertical axis, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the lanels, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit vertical axis label value, or if the values are not numerical, answer 'Not Applicable'.

Question 3: How many of the same tick values are there across all axes in the third chart and the first chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the number of the same tick values across all axes, including the case when any axis is shared across multiple subplots in the third chart and the first chart. If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value. If the third and the first charts do not have ticks with the same label on any axis, answer '0'.
