How many distinct lines are there in the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the total number of distinct lines in the chart across multiple subplots. Ignore grid lines, tick marks, and any vertical or horizontal auxiliary lines. If the plot does not contain any lines or is not considered a line plot, answer '0'.\n2. How many colours are used to draw lines respectively in the second chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the total number of colours used for the lines in the chart across multiple subplots. If the plot is not considered a line plot, answer '0'.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.

Question: How many of the same tick values are there across all axes in the second chart and the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the number of the same tick values across all axes, including the case when any axis is shared across multiple subplots in the second chart and the first chart. If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value. If these two charts do not have ticks with the same label on the vertical axis, answer '0'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",
