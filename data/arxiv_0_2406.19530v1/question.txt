Question 1: What does the vertical axis in the first chart represent?
Note that This a choice question. Your final answer should be the option that most closely matches the question.If the chart has multiple subplots, answer based on the subplot on the left and at the bottom. You should only output the option, such as A, B, C, or D, as the answer without the content in the option.
A. b [deg]
B. Temperature
C. Luminosity
D. Age [Myr]
Note that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get

Question 2: 1. How many subplots are there in the third chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the total number of subplots in the plot. If the plot does not contain subplots, answer '1'.
2. What does the horizontal axis of the second chart represent?
Note that This is a choice question. Your final answer should be the option that most closely matches the question. If the chart has multiple subplots, answer based on the subplot on the left and at the bottom. You should only output the option, such as A, B, C, or D, as the answer without the content in the option.
A. G magnitude  
B. Age in million years  
C. \( G_{BP} - G_{RP} \) color index  
D. Velocity in km/s
Now that you have got the answers for the two questions. Your answer format should be as follows:
Answer: The_answer_for_the_first_question; The_answer_for_the_second_question

Question 3: How many of the same tick values are there on the vertical axis in the third chart and the second chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the number of the same tick values on the vertical axis across multiple subplots in the third chart and the second chart. If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value. If these two charts do not have ticks with the same label on the vertical axis, answer '0'.

Question 4: 1. Which pattern, (Separated, Partially Mixing or Totally Mixing), do the clusters of Orpheus and Cupavo follow in the first chart?
Note that your answer should only be one option from (Separated, Partially Mixing, Totally Mixing).
2. What is the general trend for the dark blue dots from left to right in the subplot with the horizontal axis as I[deg] and vertical axis as V[kms^-1] in the third chart? You should only output the option, such as A, B, C, or D, as the answer without the content in the option.
A. Increasing
B. Decreasing
C. First increasing then decreasing
D. First decreasing than increasing
Note that this a choice question. Your final answer should be the option that most closely matches the question.
Now that you have got the answers for the two questions. Your answer format should as follows:
Answer: The_answer_for_the_first_question; The_answer_for_the_second_question
