        "question": "The first chart is <image>. The second chart is <image>. The third chart is <image>. Question: 1. What is difference between consecutive numerical tick values on the vertical axis in the third chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the difference between consecutive numerical tick values of the vertical axis, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit vertical axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, or if the difference is not constant between all consecutive tick values, answer 'Not Applicable'.\n2. How many labeled ticks are there on the vertical axis in the second chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the total number of labeled ticks on the vertical axis across multiple subplots. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer '0'.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.

If a chart has multiple countries from different subplots with the same name, count them as only one distinct country.
