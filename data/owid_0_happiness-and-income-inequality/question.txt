Question 3: How many of the same tick values are there on the horizontal axis in the second chart and the first chart?

If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value. If the second and the first charts do not have ticks with the same label on the horizontal axis, answer '0'.
