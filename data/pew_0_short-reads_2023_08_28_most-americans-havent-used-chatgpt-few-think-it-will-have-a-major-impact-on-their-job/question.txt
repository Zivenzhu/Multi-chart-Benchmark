Question 1: Which age group has the lowest usage rate of ChatGPT in the first chart? 
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to some text that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart. If you need to answer multiple terms, separate them with commas. Unless specified in the question (such as answering with a letter), you are required to answer the full names of subplots and/or labels by default.
Note that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get

Question 2:
1. How many colours are used for the bars in the second chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the total number of colours used for the bars in the chart across multiple subplots. If the plot is not considered a bar plot, answer '0'.
2. What is the percentage of people who have used ChatGPT for tasks at work in July 2023 in the third chart?
Note that When writing percentages, please remove the percentage sign and only keep the value, for example, convert 12% to 12. Your final answer must be grounded to a number that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart, even if it is an approximate value. You should omit the unit after any number.
Now that you have got the answers for the two questions. Your answer format should be as follows:
Answer: The_answer_for_the_first_question; The_answer_for_the_second_question

Question 3: How many of the same explicitly written labels are there on the vertical axis in the second chart and the first chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the number of the same explicitly written labels on the vertical axis across multiple subplots in the second chart and the first chart. If a chart has multiple identical explicitly written labels from different subplots, count them as only one distinct explicitly written label. If these two third charts do not have the same explicitly written labels on the vertical axis, answer '0'.
Note that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get

Question 4: Firstly identify the age group which has the largest percentage gap between for entertainment and to learn something among U.S. adults who have ever used ChatGPT in the second chart.
Then what is the overall percentage of U.S. adults in this age group who have ever used it among those having heard of it in the first chart?
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to a number that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart, even if it is an approximate value. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.
Note that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get
