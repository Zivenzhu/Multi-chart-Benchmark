Question 1: How many labeled ticks are there on the vertical axis in the first chart?
Note that your final answer should be the total number of labeled ticks on the vertical axis across multiple subplots. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer '0'.

Question 2: 1. What is the leftmost labeled tick on the horizontal axis in the third chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the tick value on the horizontal axis that is explicitly written, including the case when horizontal axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the horizontal axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.
2. What is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the vertical axis in the first chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the vertical axis, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit vertical axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, answer 'Not Applicable'.
Now that you have got the answers for the two questions. Your answer format should be as follows:

Question 3: How many of the same tick values are there on the horizontal axis in the first chart and the third chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the number of the same tick values on the horizontal axis across multiple subplots in the first chart and the third chart. If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value. If the two charts do not have ticks with the same label on the horizontal axis, answer '0'.

Question 4: 1. In how many bars are the employee rate by age group below 50 in 2022 in the first chart?
Note that your answer should be a natural number.
2. In how many bars are the employee rate by age group below 50 in 2017 in the second chart?
Note that your answer should be a natural number.
Note that you have got the answer for the above two questions, the final answer is the answer to the second question minus the answer to the first question.
