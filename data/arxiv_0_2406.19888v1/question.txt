Question 1: What is the legend in the color of yellow in the first chart?
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to some text that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart. If you need to answer multiple terms, separate them with commas. Unless specified in the question (such as answering with a letter), you are required to answer the full names of subplots and/or labels by default.
Note that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get

Question 2:
1. What is the layout of the subplots in the third chart? (Answers should m by n)?
Note that Your final answer should follow 'n by m' format, where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. If the plot does not contain subplots, answer '1 by 1'.
2. How many labeled ticks are there on the vertical axis in the second chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the total number of labeled ticks on the vertical axis across multiple subplots. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer '0'.
2. How many colours are used for the bars in the first chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the total number of colours used for the bars in the chart across multiple subplots. If the plot is not considered a bar plot, answer '0'.
Now that you have got the answers for the three questions. Your answer format should be as follows:
Answer: The_answer_for_the_first_question; The_answer_for_the_second_question; The_answer_for_the_third_question

Question 3: How many identical labels are there in the legends of the second chart and the third chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the number of identical labels in the legends of the second chart and the third chart across multiple subplots. And your final answer should account for only labels relevant to the plot in the legend, even if the legend is located outside the plot. If any of the plots do not have a legend, or if the legend is not considered relevant to the plot, answer '0'.

Question 4: Firstly extract a Bin-wise value range from [(0-50), (50-100), (100-200), (200-300)], whose EC 1: Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests has the largest Relative frequence compared with that of other ranges in the first chart.
Then for this value range of AGB ranges[Mg/ha], which position, (First, Second, Third, Fourth), does its RMSE[Mg/ha] rank in the second chart?
Note that your answer should be only one option from (First, Second, Third, Fourth).
