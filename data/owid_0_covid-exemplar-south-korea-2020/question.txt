Question 2: 
1. What is the rightmost labeled tick on the horizontal colour bar in the third chart? 
Note that Your final answer should be the tick value on the horizontal colour bar that is explicitly written, including the case when the horizontal colour bar is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal colour bar is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the colour bar at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the horizontal colour bar, answer 'Not Applicable'. 
2. What is the nearest explicitly written tick value on the vertical axis to the Daily tests per million of South Korea in the first chart?
Note that your final answer must be approximated to the nearest vertical tick value in the chart. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.
Now that you have got the answers for the two questions. Your answer format should be as follows:
