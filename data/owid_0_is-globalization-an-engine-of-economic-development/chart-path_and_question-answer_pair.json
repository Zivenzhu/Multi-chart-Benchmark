        "question": "The first chart is <image>. The second chart is <image>. The third chart is <image>. Question: What is the spatially highest labeled tick on the vertical axis in the third chart? \nNote that Your final answer should be the tick value on the vertical axis that is explicitly written, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",

        "question": "The first chart is <image>. The second chart is <image>. The third chart is <image>. Question:\n1. How many colors are used for the areas in the second chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the total number of colors used for the areas in the chart across multiple subplots. If the plot is not considered an area plot, answer '0'.\n2. What is the nearest labeled tick value on the vertical axis to the value of the light blue line at its peak in the first chart?\nNote that your final answer must be approximated to the nearest vertical tick value in the chart. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.

        "question": "The first chart is <image>. The second chart is <image>. The third chart is <image>. Question: How many of the same tick values are there on the horizontal axis in the second chart and the third chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the number of the same tick values on the horizontal axis across multiple subplots in the second chart and the third chart. If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value. If these two charts do not have ticks with the same label on the horizontal axis, answer '0'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",
