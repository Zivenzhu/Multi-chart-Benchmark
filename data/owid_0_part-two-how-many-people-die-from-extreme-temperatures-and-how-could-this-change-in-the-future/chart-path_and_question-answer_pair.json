        "question": "The first chart is <image>. The second chart is <image>. The third chart is <image>. Question: What is the spatially lowest labeled tick on the vertical axis in the first chart? \nNote that Your final answer should be the tick value on the vertical axis that is explicitly written, including the case when the vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",

How many distinct bars with the values lager than 100 are there in the second chart?\nNote that your final answer should be the total number of distinct bars in the chart across multiple subplots.
