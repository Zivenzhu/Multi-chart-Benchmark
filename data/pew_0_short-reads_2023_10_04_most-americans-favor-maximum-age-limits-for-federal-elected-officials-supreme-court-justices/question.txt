Question 1: What is the percentage of Democrats/Lean Democrats who favor putting a maximum age limit in place for Supreme Court justices in the first chart?
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to a number that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart, even if it is an approximate value. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.
Note that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get

Question 2:
1. How many distinct bars are there in the second chart?
Note that Your final answer should be the total number of distinct bars in the chart across multiple subplots. Note that If a bar has multiple segments, count it as one bar. If the plot is not considered a bar plot, answer '0'.
2. How many members of the U.S. House are aged 50-59 at the beginning of the 118th Congress in the third chart? 
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to a number that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart, even if it is an approximate value. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed. 
Now that you have got the answers for the two questions. Your answer format should be as follows:
Answer: The_answer_for_the_first_question; The_answer_for_the_second_question

Question 3: How many of the same age groups are there in the second chart and the third chart? 
Note that your final answer should be the number of the same age groups in multiple subplots of both the third and second charts. If a chart has multiple identical age groups across different subplots in one specific chart, count them as only one distinct age group. If there are no age groups that are the same in both charts, answer '0'.

Question 4: Firstly identify the age group with the largest proportion in the U.S. House at the beginning of the 118th Congress in the third chart. 
Then, what percentage of people in this age group think that it is best for a president to be in their 50s in the second chart?
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to a number that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart, even if it is an approximate value. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.
Note that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get
