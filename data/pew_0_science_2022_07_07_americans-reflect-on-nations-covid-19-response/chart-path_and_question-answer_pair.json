        "question": "The first chart is <image>. The second chart is <image>. The third chart is <image>. Question: What is difference between consecutive numerical tick values on the horizontal axis in the second chart?\nNote that your final answer should be the difference between consecutive numerical tick values of the horizontal axis, including the case when the horizontal axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis on the right. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit horizontal axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, or if the difference is not constant between all consecutive tick values, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",

How many colours are used for the bars in the first chart?\nNote that your final answer should be the total number of colours used for the bars in the chart across multiple subplots. If the plot is not considered a bar plot, answer '0'.\n2. What are the names of the labels in the legend of the second chart? (from top to bottom, then left to right)\nNote that you should write down the labels from top to bottom, then from left to right and separate the labels with commas. Your final answer should account for only labels relevant to the plot in the legend, even if the legend is located outside the plot.
