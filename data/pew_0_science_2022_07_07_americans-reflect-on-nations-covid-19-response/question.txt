Question 1: What is difference between consecutive numerical tick values on the horizontal axis in the second chart?
Note that your final answer should be the difference between consecutive numerical tick values of the horizontal axis, including the case when the horizontal axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis on the right. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit horizontal axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, or if the difference is not constant between all consecutive tick values, answer 'Not Applicable'.

Question 2:
1. How many colours are used for the bars in the first chart?
Note that your final answer should be the total number of colours used for the bars in the chart across multiple subplots. If the plot is not considered a bar plot, answer '0'.
2. What are the names of the labels in the legend of the second chart? (from top to bottom, then left to right)
Note that you should write down the labels from top to bottom, then from left to right and separate the labels with commas. Your final answer should account for only labels relevant to the plot in the legend, even if the legend is located outside the plot. If the plot does not have a legend or no legend is considered relevant to this plot, answer 'Not Applicable'.
Now that you have got the answers for the two questions. Your answer format should be as follows:
Answer: The_answer_for_the_first_question; The_answer_for_the_second_question

Question 3: How many of the same colors are used to draw bars in both the third chart and the first chart? 
Note that Your final answer should be the number of the same colors used to draw bars between the third chart and the first chart across multiple subplots. If these two charts don't have any bars with the same colour or either of them is not a bar chart, answer '0'.

Question 4: Firstly extract the issue where the result of subtracting the percentage of Rem/ lean Rem people who think about too little priority has been given from the percentage of Dep/lean Dep people is the largest across all the issues in the second chart.
Then for this issue, what is the percentage of people who think that about the right amount of attention has been given in the first chart?
Note that Your final answer must be grounded to a number that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart, even if it is an approximate value. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.
